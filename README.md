# Media Vault Library DotNet edition

Multimedia Player for WinForms, WPF and SharpDX based on FFMPEG

Full media playback for DotNet developers is finally here!

Because we still believe WinForms, WPF and managed DirectX is still alive, we decided to create robust media playback controls and libraries for you.

Generally DotNet and other managed languages suffer from lack of media playback support.
Developers who want to incorporate media playback features into their application has to deal with complicated media foundation/directshow api's.

*There is no need to search into such kind solutions. Media Vault Library for DotNet is all you need to create fully functional media players with just few lines of code*

## General features

1. Support for WinForms, WPF and other frameworks like DirectX
2. No need to use additional codecs.
3. Ultra fast hardware and software decoding of pretty much all known media formats.
4. Perfect video playback without frame skipping and stuttering.
5. Production quality, no memory leaks and amazing stability.
6. Very easy to use, you just need few lines of code to build amazing media playback application
7. Its totally free of charge for academic, personal or commercial use
8. Support for subtitles.

Media Vault Library for DotNet is production quality set of controls designed to provide media playback for your applications.

Media Vault Library for DotNet is build on top Media Vault Library Native (it is also my project), whole rendering is created in C/C++ language and uses modern techniques to decode and render media.

All libraries and controls have production quality and you can use them in your commercial projects without fear about stability, performance and memory leaks.

Of course nobody is perfect, so if you will find bug or you want to give us hint about feature request please submit ticket in Issues cathegory.

In this Wiki you will find all informations you need to use Media Vault Library.
We asure you, media playback was never easier!

# General usage #

First you have to decide which framework you want to use.

* If you are WinForms developer please skip to WinForms section.
* If you are WPF developer please skip to WPF section.
* If you want to build your own media control or you want to use media playback in game environment please visit MVLib.DotNet for DirectX section.

In above sections you will find informations about MVLib and you will find proper guide how to start using our library.

# Documentation #

We decided to not create dedicated documentation. Why?

Mainly because every method, property, class is very well documented via Visual Studio intelisense system.

Also attached samples are very easy to understand and you should be able to use our libraries after just few minutes of sample studies.

If you have any questions please leave your concerns in Issues section.

# Quick start #

Our libraries are extremelly easy to use. It should take you just couple minutes to learn how to use them.

However this project contains C++ CLI library so less expirienced developers can struggle a little with building our libraries from source.

That's why we decided to create binaries ready for use.

Also WinForms, WPF and SharpDX have dedicates samples.

Every sample project is configured to compile and start to work out of the box. Just download it, compile and enjoy.
